# DashIntern

Offical repo for SIH Internal Hackathon 2022 from team Sleep 404

## Inspiration

The problems we face when we need to find the relevant internships to start our career and have an hands-on experience in the industry is getting harder for students due to insufficient awareness and resources.

## What it does

Dashboard internships bottlenecks all the internships out there and provides a one stop solution for the students thereby saving there time to search the whole internet. It has pretty cool features like **Resume Builder**, **Curated Resources** , **Personalized portfolio**, which removes the hefty burden from the students shoulder so that they can focus on building their skills. People can build a startup, hire interns and look for funding from investors all from one place.
